Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism, however, was challenged in the early 
1940s by a new Muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India.[10] 
Eventually, in August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire[10] was partitioned 
into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan.[11] As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, 
and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. 
Eschewing the official celebration of independence in Delhi, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to 
provide solace. In the months following, he undertook several fasts unto death to stop religious violence. The 
last of these, undertaken on 12 January 1948 when he was 78,[12] also had the indirect goal of pressuring India 
to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan.[12] Some Indians thought Gandhi was too accommodating.[12][13] 

Among them was Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, who assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948 by firing three 
bullets into his chest.[13] Captured along with many of his co-conspirators and collaborators, and his 
co-conspirator Narayan Apte were tried, convicted and executed while many of their other accomplices were given 
prison sentences.
